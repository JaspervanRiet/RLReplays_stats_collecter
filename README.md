# The RLReplays Stats Collecter

Simple command line application that will connect to the www.rocketleaguereplays.com API 
and add up all the stats for a replay pack for the specified players. Useful for seeing all the stats for say, a tournament.

## How do I use it?

There are executables under the releases tab. Then go to a replay pack on the site and look at the URL.

For example: https://www.rocketleaguereplays.com/replay-packs/191/

That number at the end there is the replay pack ID, remember it.
